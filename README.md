# Physics-simulations
# Hello, this has mainly two versions of double pendulum simulation,
# One on simple pendulum characteristics, another on a Ulam's spiral of primes (Or, polar plots of p,p)
# There's one on simulating a quantum walk, which needs to be edited as the coin space roation is fixed at 45 deg.
# There's one on estimating time taken for executing a quantum walk for N steps, but it's pretty raw and unoptimised.
# There's another on simulating Harper Hamiltonian phase space plot using runge kutta method-4
# The SIR(D) method simulation is pretty basic form, required graphs can be obtained by tweaking the params in the code.
# There's more to be added soon!
